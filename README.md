The **BuddyBook Server** is the backend API for the **BuddyBook-V2** platform. This server is built using Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL to handle team management, profile creation, and sending email invitations to friends. It provides the necessary endpoints to support the front-end functionality of the BuddyBook application.

This project is inspired by a previous React app that my teammate Julia and I built. This version is built with Vite, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.
